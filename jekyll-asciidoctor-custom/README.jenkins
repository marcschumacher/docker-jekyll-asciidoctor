this image can be used within jenkins including pushing
with git to a deployment site

for permissions and ssh credentials reasons, the
jenkins host user/uid/gid and the container user should match

to use the image for git deployment, mount the ssh key directory
under /home/$user/.ssh like so:

--user $(id -u $username):$(id -g $username) 
-v /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/machinekit-ci:/home/$username/.ssh

and use the SSH agent plugin to supply the passphrase on the SSH key.
